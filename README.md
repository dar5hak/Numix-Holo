Numix Holo
==========

Numix Holo contains a widget theme (GTK+ 2 and 3) and an Xfce window decoration theme (Xfwm4). It follows the 'flat' design paradigm, as opposed to glossy, and aims to be clean and easy on the eyes.

To install it, download and extract the ZIP, and move the newly extracted 'Numix Holo' folder into ~/.themes or /usr/share/themes (works on most GNU/Linux distributions).
